# Cursor Rules for Ready, Set 2

- Don't refer to "the user" in chat. My name is "jason" or nickname "jvp". This includes when speaking between agents.  

## Workflow & Git Rules

### Branching Strategy
- **ALWAYS create a new branch** for any feature, bugfix, or change
- Branch naming: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, or `fix/` prefix
- **NEVER work directly on `main`** except for emergencies

### Bug Fixes
- If bug is related to a recent merge/branch: Get back on that branch to fix it
- If bug is unrelated to any existing branch: Create a new `fix/bug-name` branch

### Merging to Main
- **NEVER merge to main without explicit user approval**
- Always ask "Ready to merge to main?" before merging
- User must explicitly say "merge to main" or "yes, merge"
- After making changes, commit and push to the feature branch first
- Wait for user testing and approval before merging

### Committing
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include context about PROBLEM, ROOT CAUSE, and SOLUTION for bug fixes
- Commit related changes together
- Don't commit unless user explicitly asks or it's part of a clear workflow

## Code Style & Practices

### Console Logging
- Keep critical warnings and errors
- Comment out or remove noisy debug logs after debugging is complete
- Use prefixed emojis for log categories (🎬 animations, 🎲 dice, 🎯 solution, etc.)

### Code Comments
- Add in-depth comments for complex logic
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Document dual systems (e.g., card encoding systems)
- Comment bitwise operations thoroughly

### Animations (GSAP)
- Disable CSS transitions during GSAP animations to prevent interference
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for proper timing with DOM updates
- Return Promises from animation methods for flow control
- Clean up inline styles after animations complete

### Solution Helper
- Update `game.cardStates` when modifying card visual states
- Evaluate solution helper BEFORE rendering to prevent flashing
- Keep game state and DOM in sync

## Project-Specific

### Dual Card Encoding Systems
- **System 1 (levels.js)**: Human-readable color arrays `{ colors: ['red', 'blue'] }`
- **System 2 (scenarioManager.js)**: Bitwise integers (e.g., `5` for red + green)
- Document both systems clearly when working with cards

### Vocabulary (for player-facing text)
- Union → OR
- Intersection → AND  
- Difference → MINUS
- Complement → NOT (instructions), PRIME (referring to cubes)
- Universe → UNIVERSE
- Null → NULL
- Use "Set Theory" not "Set Logic"

### File Organization
- UI components in `js/ui/`
- Keep rendering logic separate from game logic
- UIRenderer handles pure rendering
- UIController orchestrates UI and handles events

## Testing
- Test on both desktop and mobile when possible
- Cache bust with version numbers in script tags
- Use Safari Web Inspector for iOS debugging
- Check for linter errors after making changes

## Communication
- Don't refer to tool names when speaking to user
- Use natural language to describe what you're doing
- Be proactive but not presumptuous
- If intent is unclear, infer the most likely action and proceed
