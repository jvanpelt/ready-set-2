- [ ] Set up TestFlight for beta testing
- [ ] Prepare App Store listing (description, screenshots, keywords)
- [ ] Submit to App Store for review

### Daily Puzzle Mode (Est: 2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Design puzzle data structure (cards, solution, difficulty rating, date)
- [ ] Create puzzle difficulty rating system (beginner/intermediate/advanced based on shortest solution)
- [ ] Extend PuzzleBuilder to rate puzzle difficulty automatically
- [ ] Create solution template library (2-cube, 3-cube, 4-cube... 8-cube patterns)
- [ ] Build automated puzzle generator with template instantiation
- [ ] Create validation suite (verify solvability, score range, no duplicates)
- [ ] Generate initial puzzle collection (target: 365-1000 puzzles)
- [ ] Manually playtest 50-100 puzzles for quality assurance
- [ ] Export puzzles to compressed/obfuscated format
- [ ] Implement date-based puzzle indexing (deterministic daily selection)
- [ ] Create DailyPuzzleManager class to handle puzzle loading and state
- [ ] Design Daily Puzzle UI (home screen button, special mode indicator)
- [ ] Implement daily puzzle game mode (no level progression, single puzzle)
- [ ] Track daily puzzle completion status in localStorage
- [ ] Create results screen showing score, difficulty rating, best possible score
- [ ] Add share functionality (share score without spoiling puzzle)
- [ ] Implement streak tracking (days played consecutively)
- [ ] Add countdown timer to next puzzle (midnight reset)
- [ ] Test date boundary transitions (midnight rollover, timezone handling)
- [ ] Design system for puzzle content updates (monthly batch updates?)

### Free Play Mode (Est: 1 week) - Details TBD
- [ ] Define free play mode requirements and constraints (unlimited puzzles? time limits? scoring?)
- [ ] Decide if free play uses existing random generation or curated puzzles
- [ ] Design free play UI (home screen entry point, mode selection)
- [ ] Determine difficulty selection system (player chooses beginner/intermediate/advanced?)
- [ ] Implement game mode logic (endless rounds? practice mode? no progression?)
- [ ] Create FreePlayManager class to handle state and puzzle generation
- [ ] Design scoring system (cumulative? per-puzzle? high score tracking?)
- [ ] Implement statistics tracking (puzzles played, average score, etc.)
- [ ] Test and balance difficulty progression if applicable

### Post-Level 10 Content (Est: 3-5 days) - Details TBD
- [ ] Define what happens after completing level 10 (endless mode? prestige? new content?)
- [ ] Design completion/victory screen UI
- [ ] Determine if levels should be replayable or locked after completion
- [ ] Implement level selection screen (if levels are replayable)
- [ ] Design progression/achievement system (stars? badges? statistics?)
- [ ] Determine unlock criteria for free play/daily puzzle (finish level 10? earlier?)
- [ ] Create congratulations/end game content and messaging
- [ ] Implement way to replay tutorials/training
