## Puzzle 1

**Template:** `color = color` / `color ∪ color ∪ color`

**Instantiate:** `red = green` / `blue ∪ gold ∪ red`

**Cards (random 8 from 16):** Indices [1,2,3,4,5,6,11,12]
```
0: ['red']               - 1
1: ['blue']              - 2  
2: ['green']             - 3
3: ['gold']              - 4
4: ['red','blue']        - 5
5: ['red','green']       - 6
6: ['red','blue','green'] - 11
7: ['red','blue','gold']  - 12
```

**Evaluate Restriction:** `red = green`
- Card 0 ['red']: has red, no green → FLIP
- Card 1 ['blue']: no red, no green → KEEP (same: both absent)
- Card 2 ['green']: no red, has green → FLIP
- Card 3 ['gold']: no red, no green → KEEP (same: both absent)

- Card 5 ['red','green']: has both → KEEP (same: both present)
- Card 6 ['red','blue','green']: has both → KEEP (same: both present)
- Card 7 ['red','blue','gold']: has red, no green → FLIP

**Active cards:** [1, 3, 5, 6] = 4 cards

**Evaluate Set Name:** `blue ∪ gold ∪ red` on [1,3,5,6]
- Card 1 ['blue']: has blue → MATCH
